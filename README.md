# P2-Divide-and-Conquer-Greedy

Java code provided is designed to find the maximum number in a sorted and circularly shifted array. The time complexity of this code is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because it uses a binary search algorithm, which divides the search space in half with each iteration.
